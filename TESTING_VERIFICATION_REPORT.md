## 2Ô∏è‚É£ GNET Partner Portal Testing (/gnet)

### Manual Test Checklist

**Platform Verification:**
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3070/gnet
- [ ] Verify purple "Partner Portal" badge displays
- [ ] Verify purple accent color scheme (vs red for retail)
- [ ] Verify same TNT logo displays
- [ ] Verify same value proposition ("Premium Transportation Pricing")

**Pricing Verification:**
- [ ] Generate same quote as retail (Hourly, Sedan, Monday, 4 hours)
- [ ] **Expected Result:**
  - Base pricing: **Identical to retail** ($360 after discount)
  - Commission info: Shows GNET commission calculation

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Groundspan Corporate Portal Testing (/groundspan)

### Manual Test Checklist

**Platform Verification:**
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3070/groundspan
- [ ] Verify blue "Corporate Account" badge displays
- [ ] Verify blue accent color scheme
- [ ] Verify same TNT logo displays
- [ ] Verify contact info (update to corporate email)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Behavior (INCORRECT)

The Groundspan portal **currently uses retail logic** with simple premium add-ons:

**Hourly Service:**
- Applies $10/hour premium over retail
- Example: Sedan = $110/hour (vs $100/hour retail)

**Point-to-Point Service:**
- Applies 15% premium over retail
- Example: $155 base becomes $178.25

**Airport Service:**
- Applies 12% premium over retail
- Example: RIC $105 becomes $117.60

### ‚ùå Why This is Wrong

Your Capital One contract has **74 specific routes** with rates calculated based on **total driver time commitment** (including drive to/from base), NOT simple percentage premiums.

**Example of Error:**

| Route | Current (Wrong) | Contract (Correct) | Difference |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| CVA ‚Üí RIC Airport | $105 + 12% = **$117.60** | **$110** (1 hour) | +$7.60 |
| CVA ‚Üí DCA Airport | $450 + 12% = **$504** | **$455** (5 hours) | +$49 |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Mapbox Address Autocomplete

### Functionality Test

- [ ] Type at least 3 characters in pickup address
- [ ] Verify dropdown appears after ~300ms
- [ ] Verify suggestions are Richmond-area biased
- [ ] Verify "Short Pump" addresses show (11800 W Broad St, etc.)
- [ ] Select an address from dropdown
- [ ] Verify field populates correctly
- [ ] Verify same works for destination address

### Known Behavior

- **Minimum 3 characters** required to trigger search
- **300ms debounce** to prevent excessive API calls
- **Richmond-area bias:** Coordinates (-77.4360, 37.5407)
- **Bounding box:** Virginia region
- **Mapbox token:** Successfully loaded from `.env.local`

### Troubleshooting

If autocomplete doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify token in `.env.local`
3. Clear `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`
4. Restart server on fresh port

**Token location:** `C:\Users\spder\tnt-transportation-platform\.env.local`

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Groundspan Pricing - Implementation Required

### Problem Statement

The Groundspan corporate pricing uses a **route-based model** where each origin‚Üídestination combination has a specific rate based on total driver time commitment. This is fundamentally different from the retail model's simple flat rates.

### What's Been Done

‚úÖ **Data Extracted:** All 74 routes from `Pricing_4_ZoneRates.xlsx` extracted to `src/config/groundspan-rates.ts`

‚úÖ **Helper Functions Created:**
- `getGroundspanRouteRate(vehicleId, origin, destination, serviceType)`
- `getGroundspanDestinations(vehicleId, origin)`
- `getGroundspanOrigins(vehicleId)`
- `validateGroundspanRoute(vehicleId, origin, destination, serviceType)`

### What Needs to Be Done

‚ùå **Update Pricing Calculator:** File `src/lib/pricing-calculator.ts` needs to:
1. Import Groundspan route functions
2. Replace premium percentage logic with route lookup
3. Return route-specific rates and estimated hours

‚ùå **Update Groundspan UI:** File `src/app/groundspan/page.tsx` needs:
1. Origin selection dropdown (Central Virginia, McLean VA, Cville)
2. Destination selection dropdown (filtered by selected origin)
3. Service type: Ground / Arrival / Departure
4. Display estimated hours in quote results

### Example Implementation Needed

**Pricing Calculator Update (src/lib/pricing-calculator.ts):**

```typescript
// Line ~122 - Replace Groundspan hourly logic
if (platform === 'groundspan' && serviceType === 'airport') {
  // Use route-based pricing instead of premium
  const route = getGroundspanRouteRate(
    vehicleId,
    origin, // from form
    destination, // from form
    'departure' // or 'arrival' based on form selection
  );

  if (route) {
    breakdown.basePrice = route.rate;
    breakdown.hours = route.estimatedHours;
    // Use route rate, not premium calculation
  }
}
```

**UI Update (src/app/groundspan/page.tsx & QuoteCalculator.tsx):**

```typescript
// Add to form fields
const [origin, setOrigin] = useState('');
const [destination, setDestination] = useState('');
const [groundspanServiceType, setGroundspanServiceType] = useState<'ground' | 'arrival' | 'departure'>('ground');

// Origin dropdown
<select value={origin} onChange={(e) => setOrigin(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="">Select Origin...</option>
  <option value="Central Virginia">Central Virginia (Richmond)</option>
  <option value="Mclean VA">McLean, Virginia</option>
  <option value="Cville">Charlottesville</option>
</select>

// Destination dropdown (filtered based on origin)
<select value={destination} onChange={(e) => setDestination(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="">Select Destination...</option>
  {getGroundspanDestinations(vehicleId, origin).map(dest => (
    <option key={dest} value={dest}>{dest}</option>
  ))}
</select>

// Service type
<select value={groundspanServiceType} onChange={(e) => setGroundspanServiceType(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="ground">Ground Transportation</option>
  <option value="departure">Airport Departure (Dropoff)</option>
  <option value="arrival">Airport Arrival (Pickup)</option>
</select>
```

### Test Cases After Implementation

Once route-based pricing is implemented, verify these:

| Vehicle | Origin | Destination | Service | Expected Rate | Estimated Hours |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Sedan (MKT) | Central Virginia | RIC Airport | Departure | $110 | 1.0 |
| Sedan (MKT) | Central Virginia | DCA Airport | Departure | $455 | 5.0 |
| Sedan (MKT) | Central Virginia | IAD Airport | Departure | $465 | 5.0 |
| Sedan (Aviator) | Central Virginia | Central Virginia | Ground | $110/hour | 1.0 |
| Limo Bus | Central Virginia | DCA Airport | Departure | $1,097 | 5.0 |
| Transit | Central Virginia | RIC Airport | Arrival | $183 | 1.0 |

**Source:** `src/config/groundspan-rates.ts` lines 59-138

### Data Error to Fix

‚ö†Ô∏è **Row 8 Error:** Line 67 in `groundspan-rates.ts`
```typescript
{ origin: 'Cville', destination: 'Central Virginia', serviceType: 'ground',
  rate: 300, rateType: 'flat', estimatedHours: 0.003 }
  //                                             ^^^^^ Should this be 3.0?
```

This shows 0.003 hours (11 seconds) which is clearly wrong. Verify with contract and update.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Pricing Accuracy Verification

### Verification Methodology

To ensure pricing accuracy before sending to Groundspan:

1. **Compare against source files:**
   - HTML files in repo: https://github.com/sperry-entelech/tnt-gnet-pricing-demo
   - Excel file: `C:\Users\spder\Downloads\Pricing_4_ZoneRates.xlsx`

2. **Manual calculation checks:**
   - Verify base rate components add up correctly
   - Verify discount percentages apply correctly
   - Verify minimum hours enforced

3. **Spot-check 10-20 quotes:**
   - Generate quotes in browser
   - Compare against manual calculation
   - Document any discrepancies

### Sample Verification Table

| Test # | Service | Vehicle | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Hourly | Sedan | 3hr Mon | $270 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 2 | Hourly | Transit | 6hr Thu | $822 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 3 | Airport | Sedan | CVA‚ÜíRIC | $105 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 4 | P2P | Limo Bus | 1hr | $370 | ___ | ‚¨ú |
| 5 | Hourly (GS) | Sedan | 3hr | $330 | ___ | ‚¨ú |

Fill in "Actual" by generating quotes in browser, mark ‚úÖ if matches, ‚ùå if error found.

### Key Rates to Verify

**Hourly Rates (3-hour minimum):**
- Sedan: $100/hour = **$300 minimum**
- Transit: $137/hour = **$411 minimum**
- Mini Bus: $142/hour = **$426 minimum**
- Stretch Limo: $160/hour = **$480 minimum**
- Limo Bus: $208/hour = **$624 minimum**

**Discount Rates:**
- Monday-Thursday: **10% off** (Friday-Sunday no discount)
- 6+ hours: **10% off** (cumulative with day discount? Check source)
- 3+ vehicles: **7% off** (fleet discount)
- 14+ days advance: **5% off** (early booking)

**Airport Flat Rates (Sedan):**
- Richmond (RIC): **$105**
- Charlottesville (CHO): **$333**
- Reagan National (DCA): **$450**
- Dulles (IAD): **$460**
- BWI: **$657**

### Questions for Pricing Accuracy

1. **Are discounts cumulative?**
   - Example: Monday booking with 6 hours = 10% + 10% = 20% total?
   - Or: Monday booking with 6 hours = apply only best discount (10%)?

2. **Do Groundspan corporate clients get discounts?**
   - Contract rates already negotiated, so probably NO discounts
   - Verify this assumption

3. **What about gratuity for Groundspan?**
   - Is gratuity included in route rates?
   - Or should it be added separately?

4. **Point-to-point billing increments:**
   - After 1st hour, billing in 30-minute increments
   - Is partial time rounded up? (e.g., 1.3 hours = 1.5 hours billed?)
