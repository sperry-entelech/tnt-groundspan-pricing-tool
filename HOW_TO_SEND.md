# 📦 How to Package and Send the Codebase

## 📁 Codebase Location
```
C:\Users\spder\tnt-transportation-platform
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Method: Use File Explorer

### Step 1: Clean Up Before Packaging
1. Delete these folders (they're huge and will be regenerated):
   - `node_modules` (150+ MB)
   - `.next` (build cache)

### Step 2: Create ZIP File
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\spder`
3. Right-click on `tnt-transportation-platform` folder
4. Select **"Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"**
5. This will create `tnt-transportation-platform.zip`

### Step 3: Share
- Email the ZIP file (should be ~5-10 MB without node_modules)
- Or upload to Google Drive/Dropbox and share link
- Or push to GitHub (recommended)

## 🎯 Alternative: Push to GitHub (Recommended)

This is the cleanest method:

```bash
cd C:\Users\spder\tnt-transportation-platform

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files (node_modules and .next already in .gitignore)
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Complete TNT Transportation Platform with Groundspan route-based pricing"

# Create GitHub repo (if you haven't)
# Go to github.com and create new repository: tnt-transportation-platform

# Add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tnt-transportation-platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then share the GitHub repo link!
