## Rate Examples

### Hourly Rates (3-hour minimum)

| Transit | $137/hr | $147/hr (+$10 premium) |

| Sedan | $155 | Flat gratuity, no hourly driver pay |
| Transit | $225 | 30-min increments after minimum |
| Executive Mini Bus | $240 | Additional time at 70% of rate |
| Mini Bus Sofa | $240 | |
| Stretch Limo | $300 | |

## Business Logic Highlights

### Discount Stacking
Discounts apply sequentially (compounding):
1. Weekday (10% if Mon-Thu)
2. Long trip (10% if 6+ hours)
3. Short notice (15% if same/next day)
4. Multi-vehicle (10% if 2+ vehicles)
5. Corporate (15% if corporate platform)

Example: $600 base → -10% weekday → -10% long trip → -15% late = ~$409.50

### Platform Differences

**Retail:**
- Standard rates
- All discounts available
- All surcharges apply

**GNET:**
- Same as retail rates
- All discounts available
- All surcharges apply
- Partner gets 12% commission (standard) or 15% (airport/premium)

**Groundspan:**
- Premium rates (higher than retail)
- NO standard discounts (premium service instead)
- After-hours included in base rate
- Priority booking, dedicated account manager

**Corporate:**
- Standard rates
- 15% corporate discount PLUS all other discounts
- Monthly billing, Net 30 terms

### Point-to-Point Special Logic
- 1-hour minimum (vs 3-hour for hourly)
- Flat gratuity (not per hour)
- No hourly driver pay component
- Additional time billed in 30-minute increments
- Additional time charged at 70% of standard rate

## TypeScript Type Safety

All modules are fully typed using the interfaces defined in `@/types/pricing.ts`:
- `VehicleType`
- `HourlyPricing`
- `PointToPointPricing`
- `AirportPricing`
- `Discount`
- `Surcharge`
- `PriceBreakdown`
- `QuoteResult`

The pricing calculator returns `DetailedBreakdown` which extends `PriceBreakdown` with additional calculation details.

## Usage in Production

```typescript
import { calculatePrice } from '@/lib/pricing-calculator';

// Calculate any service
const breakdown = calculatePrice({
  vehicleId: 'sedan',
  platform: 'retail',
  serviceType: 'hourly',
  serviceDate: new Date('2025-11-15'),
  hours: 5,
  pickupTime: '14:00'
});

console.log(breakdown.total); // Final price
console.log(breakdown.discounts); // Applied discounts
console.log(breakdown.surcharges); // Applied surcharges
```

## Data Sources

All data extracted from:
- `C:\Users\spder\tnt-gnet-demo\comprehensive-pricing-engine.html` (primary source)
- `C:\Users\spder\tnt-gnet-demo\index.html` (verification)
- `C:\Users\spder\tnt-gnet-demo\gnet-partner-booking.html` (GNET details)
- `C:\Users\spder\tnt-gnet-demo\capital-one-booking.html` (Groundspan premium)
- `C:\Users\spder\tnt-gnet-demo\js\airport-zone-pricing.js` (zone-based airport rates)

Data cross-referenced across all sources to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Special Notes

1. **Gratuity Included:** All rates include driver gratuity
2. **Pass-Through Costs:** Tolls and parking fees added at time of service
3. **Round Trip Airport:** Multiply one-way rate by 1.8 (from demo logic)
4. **Minimum Hours:** Hourly = 3 hours, Point-to-Point = 1 hour
5. **After-Hours:** 11pm-6am pickups, $20 flat fee (except Groundspan)
6. **Holidays:** Major US holidays get 25% surcharge
7. **Groundspan Premium:** Always higher than retail, includes premium features
8. **GNET Commission:** 12% standard services, 15% airport/premium

## Next Steps

The pricing data is now fully integrated and ready for use in the Next.js production application. You can:

1. Import pricing functions in API routes
2. Use in booking forms for real-time quotes
3. Display rate comparisons to customers
4. Calculate GNET partner commissions
5. Generate accurate invoices for all platforms

All data is immutable and properly typed for production use.

## Validation

To validate the pricing system works correctly, you can run test calculations:

```typescript
// Test 1: Basic hourly (should be $300)
const test1 = calculatePrice({
  vehicleId: 'sedan',
  platform: 'retail',
  serviceType: 'hourly',
  serviceDate: new Date('2025-11-15'),
  hours: 3,
  pickupTime: '14:00'
});
console.assert(test1.total === 300, 'Basic hourly test failed');

// Test 2: With weekday discount (should be $270)
const test2 = calculatePrice({
  vehicleId: 'sedan',
  platform: 'retail',
  serviceType: 'hourly',
  serviceDate: new Date('2025-11-10'), // Monday
  hours: 3,
  pickupTime: '14:00'
});
console.assert(test2.total === 270, 'Weekday discount test failed');

// Test 3: Groundspan premium (should be $330)
const test3 = calculatePrice({
  vehicleId: 'sedan',
  platform: 'groundspan',
  serviceType: 'hourly',
  serviceDate: new Date('2025-11-10'),
  hours: 3,
  pickupTime: '14:00'
});
console.assert(test3.total === 330, 'Groundspan premium test failed');
```
