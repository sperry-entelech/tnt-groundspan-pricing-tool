## 📊 How Route-Based Pricing Works

### Your Contract Model
Unlike retail pricing (simple $100/hour), your corporate rates are **route-specific** and based on **total driver time commitment**.

**Example: Central Virginia → DCA**

| What | Time |
|------|------|
| Driver leaves base → Pickup location | 30 min |
| Pickup → DCA | 2 hours |
| Service/wait time | 30 min |
| DCA → Back to base | 2 hours |
| **Total Driver Commitment** | **5 hours** |
| **Your Rate** | **$455** |

This is why your DCA rate ($455) is different from the retail rate - **it includes the full round-trip driver commitment**.
