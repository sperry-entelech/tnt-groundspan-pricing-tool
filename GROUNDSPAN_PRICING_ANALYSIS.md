## üí° Billing Logic Explanation

**User's Key Insight:**
> "We calculate corporate airport runs or zone deals based on how many hours it would take us to do the job including driving to the zone to pick them up and driving home"

### Example Breakdown: DCA Airport Transfer

**Scenario**: Groundspan employee needs dropoff at Reagan National Airport (DCA)

**Time Calculation:**
1. **Drive from TNT base ‚Üí Central Virginia pickup** = ~30 min
2. **Central Virginia ‚Üí DCA** = ~2 hours
3. **Wait/service time** = ~30 min
4. **Drive from DCA ‚Üí TNT base** = ~2 hours
5. **TOTAL DRIVER TIME** = **~5 hours**

**Therefore:**
- Estimated Hours: 5.0
- Rate: $455 flat (for sedan)
- This covers the ENTIRE 5-hour commitment of the driver

This is why longer-distance routes have higher flat rates - they reflect the full time the driver is committed to the job, not just the passenger ride time.

2. **Route Completeness**: Are there any other origins/destinations needed beyond what's in the spreadsheet?
3. **Rate Updates**: How often do these corporate rates change?
4. **Billing Terms**: Should quotes show the "estimated hours" to corporate users, or keep it hidden?
